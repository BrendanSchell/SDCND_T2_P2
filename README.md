# Project 7 - Unscented Kalman Filter in C++
The goal of this project is to create an Unscented Kalman filter implementation in C++.

The project reads both sequential sample radar and lidar measurement data from the files in the data folder and estimates the positions and velocities in two dimensions. These estimates are performed using the Unscented Kalman Filter equations.
